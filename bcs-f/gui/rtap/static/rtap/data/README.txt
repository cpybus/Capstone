This directory holds a databaseImage.json file which was previously used for debugging purposes. The file contains a snapshot of data from the back-end and could be used in testing UI features using stagnant aircraft. Within the main.js file, if utils.loadDatabaseSnapshot is called, the data from this file will be displayed. Note that this is not recommended now that live data is fully implemented.
